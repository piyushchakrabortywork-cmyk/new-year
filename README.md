# 🎆 First Project of 2026

Happy New Year 2026 🥂  
No roadmap. No rules. Just building.

This project exists because:
- I wanted to start 2026 by shipping something
- Overthinking is boring
- Chaos = creativity

---

## ⚡ What is this?
A random but serious experiment.  
Might evolve. Might break. Might surprise.

---

## 🛠️ Built With
- Curiosity
- Late-night energy
- Web tech (obviously)

---

## 🚀 Status
🧪 In progress  
🔥 Actively breaking & fixing things

---

## 🧠 Why?
Because the best way to learn is to **build first, think later**.

---

## 🎯 2026 Rule
Ship more.  
Fear less.

---

⭐ Star it if you like chaos.
